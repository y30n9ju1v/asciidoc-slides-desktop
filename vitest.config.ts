// duplicated (not imported) from there is the "@" -> src alias: any component test that
// transitively imports a shadcn/ui component (which all use "@/lib/utils") needs it
// resolvable here too, same target, so it's kept in sync by hand rather than sharing
// config with the Tauri-specific file above.
